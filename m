We have run into the problem of subtests (or nested tests, both using
TAP13) in Fuego.  I recall that this issue came up in kselftest, and I believe
we discussed a solution, but I don't recall what it was.

Can someone remind me what kselftest does to handle nested tests
(in terms of TAP13 output)?

This is a significant problem.  In Fuego we output each line with a test id prefix,
which goes against the spec, but helps solve this.  Test output should be
kept separate from system output, but if I understand correctly, there are no
channels in prinkt to use to keep different data streams separate.

How does kselftest deal with this now?

IMHO the diagnostic data does not have to be in YAML.  That's only
if there's a well-known schema for the diagnostic data, to make the
data machine-readable.   TAP13 specifically avoided defining such a
schema.  I need to look at TAP14 and see if they have defined something.
(Thanks for bringing that to my attention.)

The important part, since there are no start and end delimiters for each
testcase, is to structure output (including from unrelated sub-systems
affected by the test) to either occur all before or all after the test line.
Otherwise it's impossible to sensibly parse the diagnostic data and associate it
with a test.  (That is, the TAP lines become the delimiters between each testcase's
output and data).  This is a pretty big weakness of TAP13.  Since the TAP line
has the test result, it usually means that the subsystem output for the test
is emitted *before* the TAP line.  It's preferable, in order to keep the
data together, that the diagnostic data also be emitted before the TAP
line.

I agree, for now.

I think if we start to see some patterns for some data that many tests
output, we might want (as a kernel community) to define a YAML
schema for the kselftest output.  But I think that's biting off too much
right now.  IMHO we would want any YAML schema we define to
cover more than just unit tests, so the job of defining that would be
pretty big.

This would be a good discussion to have at a testing micro-conference
or summit. :-)

Sounds good.  Thanks for working on this.
