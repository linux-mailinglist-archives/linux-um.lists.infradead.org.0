Hello Johannes,

Thanks for the review.

Indeed....  We will describe more to be understandable.

Yes, this was a device (hv)-side implementation.

LKL currently takes 2-stage build: pure kernel part (arch/um/lkl) and
userspace one (tools/lkl).  Though I think it's good to have clear
distinction in different directories, we can move tools/lkl under arch/um, if
this is the better way.

I understand.

If there is a need for in-process virtio device implementation (as LKL
does), connecting to vanilla virtio mmio driver, I hope it's still
valuable.

thanks.  the revert commits are required for Windows host target, which
uses '_' prefix for the symbols.

We will refine the log thorough the all commits and get you back.

ah, good catch.
maybe giving an example of the contents of auto.conf should be helpful.
We will address this in next patchset.

I agree to start with simple struct and expand it afterward.  We will
address this in next round.

kernel-doc is something we didn't test so far.
We will also test in advance.

Thank you again for the detailed review.
